Anime To Watch App
===============

****Most of the coding will be done at first in a java console format, but for mass use will be converted to a c# forms application for a better looking ui. Eventual android application is a possibility as well.****

This application will allow the user to randomly choose an anime to watch from multiple different types of input.
Inputs will include(but not limited to):

-Myanimelist export data
-Anime-Planet export data
-Folders from  users own directories
-TextFile
-From a prebuilt dictionary of anime
