Anime To Watch App
===============

****Most of the coding will be done at first in a java console format, but for mass use will be converted to a c# forms application for a better looking ui. Eventual android application is a possibility as well.****

Inputs will include(but not limited to):  
1.Myanimelist export data  
2.Anime-Planet export data  
3.Folders from  users own directories  
4.TextFile  
5.From a prebuilt dictionary of anime
